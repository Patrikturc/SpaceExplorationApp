# HND Project
Upon running the program, select who would you like to register as. Enter the mandatory information and a pop-up with your username will be displayed. This username in combination with the password you chose will allow you to login to the system and see relevant information based on your selected role.\
\
This application allows three different views based on who logs in. You can register as a visitor, researcher and manager. Each has access to variables that they require. This is achieved using polymorphism and good OOP practices. All public methods are commented and provide explanations to what purpose they serve.\

UI needs to be improved, it was one of my first projects developed in 2020 using WPF.
There is a simple implementation of account name and password security, which for the convenience of testing and grading was made simple and allows passwords that are not secure.
